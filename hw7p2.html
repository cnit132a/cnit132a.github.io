        <h1>Shaping Content Around Image </h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Shaping around the house</h2>
            <img class="house" src="house.png" alt="house image">
            <p>This is a paragraph that will start on the right side of the house shape and the CSS substituted the
                float of the Image (the hous.png) to use the CSS Shapes properties. This page was modified for that
                purpose and you will see that these two paragraphs will then follow the shape of that house following
                any curve, or diagonal line you see instead of just following a rectangular shape of the width and
                height of the image.</p>
            <p>This is the start of the second paragraph and this paragraph will also the shape of the house and the
                second paragraph is here just to show to out that it will follow the house until the shape ends when
                then the content will align as it is the default of the browser</p>
            <p>This is the third paragraph and, by now, I am not sure if this paragraph will be written on the right
                side of the image or the paragraph has been placed below the image starting on the left side of the
                browser and being normally displayed as any other element of a web page.</p>
